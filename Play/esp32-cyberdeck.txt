# ESP-32 CyberDeck

This is a sketch idea is for a future-proof esp32 CyberDeck

# Features

esp32 is powerful, however, it is
limited in size of binaries, to get
the most functionality we split it up
in physical hardware plug-in components.

You need more storage, get another
webcache co-processor, lol?

- esp32 webcache storage co-processor
  - adafruit web/bt coprocessor
  - esp32 libcurl
  Implements libcurl down/up-loader
  and web-cache using the internal
  flash. It also handles cert/ssh etc.
  - esp32 miniz zlib compressor
  - esp32 webserver
  - esp32 "fileserver" api (CHORD?)

- esp32 display co-processor
  - output directly to vga (bitluni)
  - advanced terminal vt100+ (fabio lib)
  - ./w web-terminal/browser-UI
  - (run on 4.7" ePaper display module?)
  - (run on vga32)
  - in/out of remote display VNC (client+server)

- esp32 magnios
  - a functional "cloud-computer"
  - serial usb-interface
  - replicatable state (add-only)
  - built-in macro-language (jml)
  - built-in editor (imacs)
  - built-in lisp (esp-lisp)
  - built-in panda (not exist yet)
  - (ncurses as window system?)
  - stateless persisten processes/tasks
    (i.e. state persistent ONLY)
    (no cache/state in RAM)
    (means can hot-swap w/o data-loss)
